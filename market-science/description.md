# Market Research

Market Research completely overhauls the traditional science pack + labs progression system. Instead, deliver requested items to markets to unlock new research!

* Markets spawn randomly around the world, with at least one guaranteed in the starting area.
* Labs are disabled! while you can build labs and put science into them, their research speed is set to 0. They will do nothing except consume power.
* Order sizes start small, but scale and grow over time.

## Thanks
This is a remake of TheThunderBirds' https://mods.factorio.com/mod/marketscience.

Additional inspiration and coding examples pulled from
* exfret's https://mods.factorio.com/mod/propertyrandomizer
* cakem's https://mods.factorio.com/mod/fishmode

Special thanks to daeder102 and TheLostNinja for testing.

## Compatibility

* I make no promises that this will work with other mods. In particular, this mod cannot handle recursive sets of recipes aside from
hard-coded exceptions for vanilla recipes (barrel + unbarrelling, uranium feedback loop, coal liquefication).
* I have no plans to further maintain or extend this mod. Feel free to fork & tweak as you wish.
